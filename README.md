This is my final project for COMS3162: Developing Accessible User Interfaces and the process of building this site has greatly expanded my knowledge of adaptive controllers and accessible gaming in general. As a result, I can see the progress and innovation in the field that has greatly expanded the ability of all people to participate in online games or video games, and I can also see where there is room for improvement. If I had more time on this project, I would have liked to implement a more robust games database using Flask or some other database management system. I also would have liked to include even more content and resources, as there is really no consolidated place for this information. I definitely think this project and this class have changed the way I view accessibility as a developer. I aim to bring all of the lessons and shortcomings into my future work, so that anything I build is accessible as possible.
